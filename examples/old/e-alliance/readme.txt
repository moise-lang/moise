(this code is not working anymore -- use jacamo examples instead)
(it is kept in the repository as an example of moise XML file)


This directory contains some moise+ examples on the
E-Alliance application domain.

Example 1
---------

It is a program that creates an OE with the OS1 and
"runs" some social events on it by calling the OE's methods.
(see the TestOnOS1.java)

To run:
   $ java -classpath ../../lib/moise.jar:. TestOnOS1



Example 2
---------

it is a program that allows the user to generate social events and see the
result (or error) in a graphical interface.

To run, start the "simOE" script
   $ simOE.sh
